The Job Listings Web Application is a dynamic platform built using React for the frontend and Flask API with Python for the backend. It automates the process of scraping real-time job postings from actuarylist.com using Selenium and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. Users can securely manage job listings through intuitive features like search, filter, add, and delete. The application displays the most recent job listings by default and allows advanced filtering to help users find relevant opportunities efficiently. This project demonstrates skills in full-stack development, automation, and database integration.
